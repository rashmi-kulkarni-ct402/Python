# Python Assignments
This folder contains two projects implemented in Python:

## 1. Gaussian Elimination
### Description:
Gaussian elimination is a method used to solve systems of linear equations by converting the augmented matrix into an equivalent upper triangular form.

### Files:
**gaussian_elimination.py**: Python code implementing the Gaussian elimination algorithm.

## 2. Lagrange Interpolation
### Description:
Lagrange interpolation is a method used to estimate values between known data points by constructing a polynomial that passes through the data points.

### Files:
**lagrange_interpolation.py**: Python code implementing the Lagrange interpolation algorithm.

#### Note:
Each subfolder for these projects contains a more detailed README file with specific explanation of code and output screenshot.
